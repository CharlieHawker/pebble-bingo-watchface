My first forays into Pebble development have resulted in this. Think of it what you will, but I'm mighty proud, as I'm not a C developer.

Description
-----------
- 3x3 grid of cells
- Random integers appear in each cell in grid with exception of:
  - One randomly assigned cell containing the hour (highlighted and bold)
  - One randomly assigned cell containing the minute (highlighted and regular)
- Each minute the cell contents and hour / minute cells redistribute
